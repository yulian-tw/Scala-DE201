# Scala DE201 - First SBT

A repo to learn [Scala with sbt using command line](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html#using-the-command-line).

It's part of the _DE201_ course using scala as programming language. Experimenting with JDK 17 and Scala 3.2. See: [`.tool-versions`](./.tool-versions)

#### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies.
   ```
    asdf install
   ```
2. Run `sbt new scala/scala3.g8`. This pulls a project template from GitHub. When prompted, name the application `hello-world`. This will create a project called `hello-world`.
   - Study the `hello-world` repo generated by the tool.

#### Reference
- Continuous learning from: [My First SBT](https://github.com/yulian-tw/My-First-SBT) which follow [sbt by example](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html).
